  abstract = {This paper describes a tool called \emph{vpoiso} that was developed to isolate errors automatically in the \emph{vpo} compiler system. The two general types of compiler errors isolated by this tool are optimization and nonoptimization errors. When isolating optimization errors, \emph{vpoiso} relies on the \emph{vpo} optimizer to identify sequences of changes, referred to as transformations, that result in semantically equivalent code and to provide the ability to stop performing \emph{improving} (or unnecessary) transformations after a specified number have been performed. A compilation of a typical program by \emph{% vpo} often results in thousands of \emph{improving} transformations being performed. The \emph{vpoiso} tool can automatically isolate the first \emph{ improving} transformation that causes incorrect output of the execution of the compiled programs by using a binary search that varies the number of \emph{% improving} transformation performed. Not only is the illegal transformation automatically isolated, but \emph{% vpoiso} also identifies the location and instant the transformation is performed in \emph{vpo}. Nonoptimization errors occur from problems in the front end, code generator, and \emph{necessary} transformations in the optimizer. If another compiler is available that can produce correct (but perhaps more inefficient) code, then \emph{vpoiso} can isolate nonoptimization errors to a single function. Automatic isolation of compiler errors facilitates retargeting a compiler to a new machine, maintenance of the compiler, and supporting experimentation with new optimizations.},
